This is old example with spring-boot parent 2.0.0-release.  
It depends on spring-hateoas 0.24.0.RELEASE, this version use  
EmployeeListVO extends **ResourceSupport**  
and controller use  
**ControllerLinkBuilder**  
to create links.

The above is all deprecated from spring-boot 2.2.2-release, you can see example: rest-hateoas.
